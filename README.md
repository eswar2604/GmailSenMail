Project: GMailTest Automation
Author: Mahesh

Requirements : Selenium , selniumbase or undetected_chromedriver

Description: In This Project the tasks has to be perfomed on GMail which is a major mail service provider by Google, Inc.

Generally , GMail will not encourage any kind of automation to prevent bots in raelworld.
Inorder to bypass Automation Detectors , we need to use Selenium Webdriver in stealth mode for that seleniumbase and undetected_chromedriver are best suited options.

Inorder to make this script working , Replace the username and password. Create and use app_password from Google Account.

If It Prompts For 2FA please complete it , Added 20sec Sleep time to complete it

For Test Cases , All Asserts are followed with a successs print messages as assert will print message andterminate the program if condition fails.

For Security Reasons all the credentials has been removed. 

Perfoming automation with some of the google based products is always challenging as they always try to block or prevent bot environments.
